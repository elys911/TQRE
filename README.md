TQRE — Transcendental Quantum Resonance Equation

Status: Open-source philosophical experiment  
Domain: Logic, Physics, Perception, and Transcendence

What is TQRE?

TQRE (Transcendental Quantum Resonance Equation) is not just a mathematical construct, it’s a bridge between observable phenomena and non-observable causes. It seeks to define *light* not only as a physical medium, but as a **logical intersection** between form and meaning.

Why?

Because some questions can't be answered by data alone.  
Because some truths exist between wavelengths of logic and whispers of the unseen.  
Because **understanding light** means **understanding existence itself.**

Formula

You can view the core TQRE formula here:

The formula itself is experimental, intuitive, and open to reinterpretation.  
This is not a rigid law, this is a **living equation.**

For Whom?

- For thinkers who feel misplaced in common academia.
- For physicists who see poetry in equations.
- For mystics who crave formal structures.
- For those who look at the stars and whisper, *"I know you're trying to tell me something."*
