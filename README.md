## What is TQRE?

TQRE (Transcendental Quantum Resonance Equation) is not just a mathematical construct —  
it is a bridge between observable phenomena and non-observable causes.

It seeks to define **light** not merely as a physical medium,  
but as a **logical intersection between form and meaning**.

---

## Why?

Because some questions can't be answered by data alone.  
Because some truths exist between wavelengths of logic and whispers of the unseen.  
Because **understanding light** means **understanding existence itself.**

The formula is experimental, intuitive, and open to reinterpretation.  
This is not a rigid law — this is a **living equation.**

- For mystics who crave formal structures.  
- For those who look at the stars and whisper, *"I know you're trying to tell me something."*
