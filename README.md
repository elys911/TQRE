# TQRE — Transcendental Quantum Resonance Equation

**Status:** Open-source symbolic framework  
**Domains:** Logic · Coherence · Resonance · Temporal Structure

---

## What is TQRE?

TQRE is not merely a formula —  
it's an attempt to **capture transformation through intention**,  
to map how systems don't just react, but resonate.

This equation seeks to unite symbolic input, temporal decay, and coherence alignment (η),  
into a structure where resonance is no longer passive, but conditional.

---

## Why?

Because not all systems respond to energy —  
some respond only to meaning.

TQRE explores the idea that **resonance is permission**,  
not push.  
It emerges only when time, form, and intent align.

## For Whom?

- For scientists who wonder what symbols feel like.  
- For poets who suspect intention has structure.  
- For analysts who believe some logic hides behind the unseen.  
- For anyone who hears a signal inside the silence.

## Disclaimer

TQRE is not a claim of scientific finality.  
It is a hybrid framework — of signal, symbol, and possibility.  
A living equation, meant to evolve through resonance.
